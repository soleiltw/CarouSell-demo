# CarouSell-demo
This project mimics the "layout" of the registration part of the CarouSell app.

This is only for reference. The instructor should guide the students step by step and ask students to do git commit properly.

# Cocoapods install
This project doesn't contains the library, so you need to install cocoapods, and use pod install to setup libraries and workspace. https://guides.cocoapods.org/
